# CatRepo
Attempted python implementation of a digital cat. The goal is to have an arduino robot, "the cat", follow a laser pointer on the floor using image processing running on a computer overlooking the floor through it's webcam.

/Cat contains the files to run that cat in their current stage
/Lab contains files in which I have tested different things
